# Covid_19_India-Analysis
Hi Folks! This project is an Analysis of Covid-19 in India. In this project, I have performed all the steps that are required for the analysis including data cleaning,
feature engineering, data visualization and analysis. For Visualization, I have used Tableau and all the visuals are in the form of tableau file. Each tableau file shows 
analysis of different scenarios and Now let's move to the project.
